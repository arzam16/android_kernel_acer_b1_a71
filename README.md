This repository contains the source code of Android kernel for Acer Iconia B1-A71 tablet. **Most likely building this repository will fail**, because the source code doesn't appear to be complete. Please refer to the Acer B1-**710** kernel source, built binaries should work on both tablets as they have very similar hardware.

This repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/arzam16/android_kernel_acer_b1_a71) and [Gitee](https://gitee.com/arzamas-16/android_kernel_acer_b1_a71).
